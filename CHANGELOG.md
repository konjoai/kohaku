All notable changes to Kohaku are documented here.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-28

### Added
- Core HDC engine: random generation (LCG-seeded bipolar ±1), bundle (majority vote), bind (element-wise multiply), permute (circular shift)
- Cosine similarity and Hamming distance metrics with mathematical invariant tests
- `EpisodicMemory` struct with FIFO capacity management
- Associative retrieval: top-k (sorted descending) and threshold-based query
- CLI binary with `demo` and `bench` subcommands (ASCII table output, no external table crate)
- Python bridge script (`python/kohaku.py`) with `KohakuMemory` class (LCG-compatible vector generation, subprocess CLI bridge)
- Integration test suite: 8 core tests + bonus threshold test covering orthogonality, similarity, bundle, permute, store/retrieve, top-k ordering, capacity eviction, bind round-trip
